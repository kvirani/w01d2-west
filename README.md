## 5 - Recap & Takeaways [5m]

- Working incrementally! How?
- Errors are our friends, let's actually cause them to control our dev workflow
- Best practices with git: 
  - don't init within existing git repo
  - git status ALL THE TIME
  - git add specific files (good habit)
  - good commit messages (look into multi line plz)
  - push frequently even if you are not collab (backup)
- How to google effectively
- Experiment with the node REPL when learning new functions etc
  - Documentation is good for examples, but not hands on!
- Harass the mentors. They are bored and want more friends
  - Code reviews
  - Asking for advanced tips ("how did X do Y?")
- Start talking to your desk mates (diff from yesterday)
